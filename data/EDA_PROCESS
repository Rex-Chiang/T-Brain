what ever the dataset

check the dimensions(shape ) of the dataset.

check the numerical features and categorical features with select_dtypes

check the skewness of numerical features and fix it with box cox transformations

transform numerical features to categorical features like year and months

create new features if needed

find the missing values in both num and cat features and fill with appropriate values like mean,median,mode

encode the cat features with onehotencoder, labelencoder

scale the features with standardscaler,robust scaler

and fit it with the estimator

if needed do features_selection for the most imp features

ifneeded regularization of features

hence it is completely iterative process to get the best model.
